    <p>Indoor drumline takes place during basketball season. It is like a percussion only marching band, except it is in a gym. We march a bass drum line, a snare line, a tenor line, a cymbal line, and we have marimbas, xylophones, chimes bells, gongs, and pianos. We go to lots of competitions against very good groups. Last year was JL Manns first year with an indoor drumline. It takes an incredible amount of discipline to stay standing still with a very heavy drum dangling off of your shoulders. </p>
