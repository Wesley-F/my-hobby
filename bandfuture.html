    <p>This upcoming summer, I want to do this thing called DrumCore. It is basically the NFL of marching band. There are 50 different cores that compete against each other. DrumCore is only the best of the best, and I hope to march a core called "<a href="http://spiritdrumcorps.org/">Spirit of Atlanta</a>." You audition in November, and if you are accepted and sign a contract with the core, you attend many weekend camps where you learn a lot of your show In may you move in for intense 10-14 hour rehearsals, 7 days a week for 4 weeks. Then you move onto a bus and tour the entire country going to around 20-30 different competitions. But you get so much out of it that all the work you put in is worth it. </p>
